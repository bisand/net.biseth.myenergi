Adds support for myenergi products like Zappi, Eddi and Harvy. You will be able to monitor and control your devices using Homey. Start and stop charging of your EV  or control your water heater based on energy prices or total power consumption in your home. 

To be able to use this Homey app you will need a [hub from myenergi](https://myenergi.com/product/hub/) installed and connected to the internet.

## Installation
Install the [latest version](https://homey.app/no-no/app/net.biseth.myenergi/myenergi/) of myenergi app for Homey from the Homey App Store. (A [beta version](https://homey.app/no-no/app/net.biseth.myenergi/myenergi/test) is also available for those who like to live on the edge.)

## Usage
After installing the app on your Homey you will have to register your hub. You can do that in the app settings for the newly installed app (More -> Apps -> myenergi -> Configure app)
